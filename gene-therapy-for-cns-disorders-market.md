<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gene Therapy for CNS Disorders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ex Vivo</li><li>In Vivo</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gene therapy for central nervous system (CNS) disorders involves two primary market types: ex vivo and in vivo. Ex vivo gene therapy involves removing cells from the patient, modifying them to introduce therapeutic genes in a laboratory setting, and then reinfusing these modified cells back into the patient. In contrast, in vivo gene therapy delivers therapeutic genes directly into the patient's CNS, usually via vectors like viruses, aiming for direct treatment at the site of the disorder. Both approaches aim to target and alleviate neurological conditions effectively.</p></p>
