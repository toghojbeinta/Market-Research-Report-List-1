<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Friction Brake System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Disc Brake</li><li>Drum Brake</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive friction brake system market is primarily divided into two types: disc brakes and drum brakes. Disc brakes utilize a flat surface and a caliper to grip a disc, providing effective stopping power and heat dissipation, making them popular in modern vehicles. Conversely, drum brakes consist of a hollow drum that houses brake shoes, which expand against the drum's inner surface to create friction. While drum brakes are often found in older or economy models, disc brakes are favored for their superior performance and reliability.</p></p>
